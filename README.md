# firepad-preact
An implementation of firepad using preact. No npm, no transpiler. Just &lt;script> tags.

I've had many ideas that involve collaborative editing, and I prefer pure javascript applications that don't require npm/etc. This is an easy starting point to bootstrap collaborative projects using pract, firepad, and firebase.

Just open index.html
